In this simple program, I have tried to create the game of "Spin the Wheel". 

The program will ask for the number of options in the wheel from the user. Thereafter, it will randomly output one of the given options, just like spin the wheel game.

The result text file stores all the results obtained so far from this program. I have input different options in different runs of the program.
